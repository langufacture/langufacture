* About Langufacture
Langufacture is a project to study, popularize, and develop engineered
languages, and to explore the application of concepts and methods from other
disciplines, including anthropology, mathematics, logic, phenomenology, and
philosophy in the art of language construction. The material on this site is
arranged into three sections:

- Design sketches for original constructed languages
- Critiques and analyses of existing ones
- Notes on interdisciplinary research

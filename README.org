* About Langufacture
Langufacture seeks to study, popularize, and develop engineered languages, and
to explore the application of concepts and methods from anthropology,
mathematics, logic, phenomenology, and philosophy in the art of language
construction. The material on this site is arranged into three sections:

- Design sketches for original constructed languages
- Critiques and analyses of existing ones
- Notes on interdisciplinary research
